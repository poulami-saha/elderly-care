# Welcome to Elderly Care

Elderly Care is a web application where a family or an elderly person can sign up with credentials and further can also login using those. It contains 3 static pages that gives an overall idea about the website, the services being provided and the cost to be beared. The application also collectes the personal details, emergency contacts and detailed requirement of the elderly person including language and specific health issues in its interactive pages. 

At the same time caregivers can also sign up and login in the web application with their credentials. They need to upload theie certificates along with the expertise and the service details they can provide.

This application makes a perfect match of the requirements of elderly person and the services being provided by the caregivers. Hence they can request for help to these caregivers, who can approve their requests when a caregiver logs in.

## What challenge is your project working to solve?

Elderly care projects aim to address various challenges related to the well-being and quality of life of elderly individuals. Some common challenges that such projects work to solve include:

1. Social Isolation: Many elderly individuals experience loneliness and social isolation, which can have a negative impact on their mental and physical health. Elderly care projects often focus on providing social support and companionship through activities, visits, and programs.

2. Healthcare and Medical Needs: Aging often comes with increased healthcare requirements. Elderly care projects seek to provide access to medical care, regular check-ups, and assistance with managing chronic conditions.

3. Assistance with Daily Activities: As people age, they may struggle with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, and cooking. These projects offer assistance to help elderly individuals remain independent for as long as possible.

4. Cognitive Health: Dementia and cognitive decline are common issues among the elderly. Care projects work on cognitive stimulation, memory care, and Alzheimer's support to improve the mental well-being of seniors.

## How does your project submission contribute to solving it?

 I have tried to create a connection with common web and responsive application for both these elderly people along with their family and the certified or freelance caregivers. With this platform its easy to find out the perfect matching care giver for the elder member of our family. Also its a one stop platform to find the next patient for the caregiver and showcase their expertise.


## How does the solution benefit and impact society/social good?

Elderly care programs have a multi-faceted impact on society, contributing to the well-being and quality of life of older individuals while also benefiting families, communities, and the broader social fabric. These programs help create a more inclusive and compassionate society that values the contributions and well-being of all its members, regardless of age. On the other side the caregivers contribute significantly to society by delivering high-quality healthcare, promoting health and wellness, and supporting individuals throughout the lifespan. Their work has a profound impact on individual health outcomes, community well-being, and the overall functioning of the healthcare system.

## How do the chosen tech stack, technologies contribute to solving the challenge?
